## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is demand forcasting and modeling. It was interesting to learn the different business metrics and goals to consider when developing a model. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is using actual data from Intuit to be able to model and forecast demand for the call centers. Right now we are just using dummy data but I am curious how similar it is to real world data. I am excited to actually see how this work can impact and industry and a business. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make to the approach taken in the current Quarter 1 Project is more direction. It is not really clear what the goal of the Quarter 1 Project is besides learning the tools and foundations we will need for the Quarter 2 Project. There is too much variation between the different groups and not very clear set answers. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested to learn more machine learning models and different ways to tune it. I am interested in making the model as accurate and realistic as possible so it would be interesting to learn the best ways to do that.
